# Etude

:flashlight: :memo: Flash card generator with superpowers :muscle: :dizzy: :rocket:

[Etude App](https://cvharris.github.io/etude)

I made this app while studying for the GMAT to help me generate physical flash cards of my own with complex math latex

## Features

- Create flash cards with markdown and LaTeX math using Markdown-It
- Print flash cards onto actual index cards
- Organize cards into decks
- Grade the difficulty and familiarity of each card
- Practice flash cards in the Runner UI and track progress through runs

## Roadmap

- [x] Create flash cards online & offline-ready, stored in browser
- [x] Simple markdown: bold, italic, underline
- [x] Math output with Markdown-It Math
- [x] Print flash cards to 4" x 6" index cards
- [x] Organize cards into decks
- [x] Set Difficulty of a flash card
- [x] Set whether you are familiar with the card yet or not
- [ ] Practice one or more decks with a timer with the built-in Runner UI
- [ ] When practicing cards, indicate whether you knew the answer when card flipped
- [ ] Track analytics on runs: time per card, which you knew, overall time, etc.
- [ ] Replace Markdown-It with custom in-place editor, like Bear
